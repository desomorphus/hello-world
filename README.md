# hello-world
It's just the beginning

G'day everybody!

My name's Ilia and I am originally from Siberia.
At my 22 I decided to study coding, so, here you can see any changes in my progress, I hope they'll be!
On the other hand I am absolutely unsure about my skills so I am absolutely ready for every critics I am having from you!

Thank you for your attention and see you on the fields of CODING!
